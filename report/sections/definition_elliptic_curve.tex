\section{Definition}
An elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$ in long Weierstrass form is given by the following equation \cite{peter2008elliptic}:
%
\begin{align*}
E: y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4x + a_6
\end{align*}
%
with $a_i \in K$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,6\}$.
To avoid singularities on the curve, it is necessary that both partial derivatives do not vanish simultaneously for each point $(x,y)$ over $\bar{K}$%
\footnote{$\bar{K}$ denotes the algebraic closure of the field $K$}.
%
These partial derivatives are given as follows:
%
\begin{align*}
\pdv{K}{y} &= 2y + a_1 x + a_3, ~~~~~~~ \pdv{K}{x} = 3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_4 - a_1 y
\end{align*}
%
If the characteristic of the coefficient field is not equal to 2 or 3 ($\operatorname{char}(k) \neq 2,3$), we can transform the curve to short Weierstrass form. This short Weierstrass form is given as follows:
%
\begin{align*}
E_{a, b}: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
\end{align*}
%
where $a,b \in K$. 
The definition of an elliptic curve requires the curve to be non-singular. 
This means that it does not have cusps, self-intersections or isolated points. 
This non-singularity property is satisfied if and only if the discriminant of $E$ is unequal to zero:
%
\begin{align*}
\triangle = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \neq 0
\end{align*}
%
All the points on $E$ together with the imaginary point at infinity $\mathcal{O}$ form an additive group $(E, \oplus)$ \cite{peter2008elliptic}:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item The neutral element in this group is $\mathcal{O}$;
	\item The inverse of a point $P=(x,y)$ is defined as $-P = (x, -y)$, with $P + (-P) = \mathcal{O}$;
	\item Given two points $P=(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$, we have $P \oplus Q = (x_3, y_3)$ where:
	%
	\begin{align*}
	x_3 &= s^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\
	y_3 &= s(x_1 - x_3) - y_1
	\end{align*}
	%
	with
	%
	\begin{align*}
	s &= 	\begin{cases}
				\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} 	& \text{if $P \neq \pm Q$ (point addition) }\\
				\frac{3 x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}		& \text{if $P = Q$ (point doubling)}
			\end{cases}	
	\end{align*}
	%
\end{itemize}
%
If we consider a curve that is defined over the real numbers, we have a nice geometric interpretation of the addition, doubling and inversion operations.
These interpretations can be seen in \Cref{fig: elliptic curve operations geometric interpretation}.

If we work with elliptic curves, it is important to know the order of the group.
This order plays a key role in the hardness of the discrete log problem (DLP) that can be constructed with elliptic curves.
Hasse's theorem states that the number of points of an elliptic curve modulo a prime $p$ is roughly in the range of the prime $p$.
Each point on the curve also has an order.
The order of a point $P$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that:
%
\begin{align*}
[n]P = \overbrace{P \oplus \ldots \oplus P}^{n \text{ times}} = \mathcal{O}
\end{align*}
%
Some points never add up to $\mathcal{O}$, which gives them an infinite order.
The order of the neutral element is 1.
In cryptography, elliptic curves are treated on a given finite field, for example $K = \mathbb{F}_{p}$, with $p$ being a sufficiently large prime number.
Points on an elliptic curve together with the neutral element $\mathcal{O}$ have cyclic subgroups.
To make all points on the elliptic curve form a cyclic group, certain conditions have to be met.
$K = \mathbb{F}_{p}$ with $p > 3$ must hold.
In addition, the discriminant of the curve has to be non-zero (as mentioned earlier).
There are also other mathematical properties leading to cryptographic weaknesses that need to be ruled out.
Due to the complexity of constructing save curves, we often make use of standardized curves in practice.
Because we know the basic math behind elliptic curves, we can now construct a DLP over these curves \cite{paar2009understanding}:
%
\begin{definition}[Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)]
Given an elliptic curve $E$, a primitive element (also called a generator) $P$ and another element $T$. 
The discrete logarithm problem is finding the integer $d$, with $1 \le d \le \#(E)$ (with $\#(E)$ being the number of points on the curve) such that:
%
\begin{align*}
\overbrace{P \oplus P \oplus \ldots \oplus P}^{d \text{ times}} = dP = T
\end{align*}
%
\end{definition}
%
In cryptosystems, the value of $d$ becomes the private key, while the public key is $T$, where $T=(x_t, y_t)$ is a point on the curve.
