\section{Simple Power Analysis}
In Simple Power Analysis (SPA) attacks, power consumption measurements are collected during a cryptographic operation and are directly interpreted.
The attacker tries to derive the key bits more or less directly from the given trace \cite{mangard2008power}. 
This often requires detailed knowledge of the algorithm's underlying implementation executed by the device under attack. 
In the most extreme case, only one power trace can be recorded and used to perform the attack.
This is what we call a \emph{single-shot SPA attack}.
In \emph{multiple-shot SPA attacks}, the attacker is able to record multiple power traces for the same plaintext, or has the ability to supply different plaintexts.
For these attacks to work, the key used in the cryptographic algorithm must have a significant impact on the power consumption of the device under attack.
The impact of the key on the power consumption could be either directly or indirectly.
