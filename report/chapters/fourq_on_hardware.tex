fast and compact implementation of {\fourq} on FPGAs is presented in \cite{jarvinen2016four}.
As expected, this implementation is fast: it is significantly faster than any other ECC alternative over a large prime characteristic field.
In this chapter, we discuss the major components in this hardware design.
In addition, we describe some of the optimizations that have been applied compared to the original algorithm described in \cite{costello2015fourq}.

As we have seen in \Cref{subsec: Scalar multiplication}, different representations are used within {\fourqs} scalar multiplication (\Cref{algo: FourQ's scalar multiplication}).
In \cite{jarvinen2016four}, a new representation is introduced.
As the negative of a precomputed point $(X + Y, Y - X, 2Z, 2dT)$ is given as $(Y - X, X + Y, 2Z, -2dT)$, the values $-2dT$ can be precomputed.
These values can now be stored using the tuple $(X + Y, Y - X, 2Z, 2dT, -2dT)$.
This representation is referred to as $\bm{R_5}$.
During scalar multiplication, the coordinates are read in the right order: they are assembled as  $(X + Y, Y - X, 2Z, 2dT)$ or as $(Y - X, X + Y, 2Z, -2dT)$ for positive and negative digit-columns respectively.
The advantage of this approach is that there is no need for point negations during the scalar multiplication \cite{jarvinen2016four}.
This comes however at the cost of storing 8 additional elements in $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$.
In the original paper introducing {\fourq}, the recoded matrix representing the output of the scalar recoding consists of digits ($d_i$) and masks ($m_i$).
The 3 least significant bits of the values of the digit-columns, values $d_i$, are used in the scalar multiplication to select one of the eight points from the precomputed table $T$. 
The top bits of the digit-columns, values $m_i$, determine whether we add or subtract the element at the current index in our lookup table (which comes down to a simple conversion from representation $\bm{R_5}$ to $\bm{R_2}$).
However, \cite{jarvinen2016four} denotes the column values used to index the table with $v_i$, and uses $s_i$ (i.e. the sign of the digit-column) to denote the mask values.
Besides these naming differences, the algorithms presented in the two papers are exactly the same.
