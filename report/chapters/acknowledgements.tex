\begin{abstract}
	First I would like to thank my supervisors Lejla Batina and Pedro Massolino for granting me the opportunity to work on this project. In particular I would like to thank Pedro for his time and patience to answer my (sometimes) endless stream of questions, helping me in the lab setting up the equipment and bringing up suggestions when I was facing difficult problems.
	I would also like to thank Matthias and Abdullah for our amazing times at both the TU/e and the RU.
	In addition, I also want to thank all the people from NSN with whom I have had a great time with. 
	Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their support throughout the years of studying in Nijmegen.
	Without all of you, I would not have been the person I have become now.
