describe the side-channel attack used to evaluate the hardware design of {\fourq} (presented in \cite{jarvinen2016four}) in this chapter. 
We first explain Simple Power Analysis (SPA).
We then introduce the concept of \emph{template attacks}.
This is a powerful type of side-channel attack in which profiles are created for the targeted device that are used later on to obtain the secret key.
After that, we look into a different flavor of template attacks that is called \emph{Online Template Attacks} (OTA). 
This improvement of template attacks reduces the number of required template traces to perform the attack.
