details of {\fourq} are described in this chapter.
{\fourq} is a scalar multiplication algorithm that makes use of a four-dimensional GLV decomposition to increase its performance.
Compared to other constant-time alternatives, {\fourq} is fast and performs better than any other known software alternative after its appearance \cite{costello2015fourq}. 
In addition, {\fourq} has been designed with simplicity in mind, and even some speed trade-offs have been made to ensure this.
As {\fourq} supports both variable and fixed-base scalar multiplication, it can be used to achieve fast Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange.
