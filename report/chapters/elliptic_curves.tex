\chapter{Elliptic Curves} \label{chp: Elliptic Curves}

this chapter, we discuss the basics of elliptic curves.
We specifically take a look at (twisted) Edwards curves, operations on points on these curves and alternative point representations for these curves.
Alternative representations provide faster point addition and doubling.
Multiple of such efficient representations are used internally in {\fourq} (see \Cref{chp: FourQ}).
For more information on finite fields, we refer to the excellent section on finite fields with respect to AES in \cite[ยง4.3]{paar2009understanding}.
